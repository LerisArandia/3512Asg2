This assignment was designed to implement knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, and MySql. There is also use of AJAX.
It was first hosted through XAMPP to test PHP and MySQL connections but was later deployed through Google Cloud Platform.

The assignment is essentially a travel photo website where users can browse photos, and save their favorites. Photos can be filtered and viewed in multiple ways according to pages they visit.
